This repository contains code to compute binned Fourier power. This code 
was originally developed for Lescroart, Stansbury, & Gallant (2015), and 
was also used in Lescroart & Gallant (2018). It was inspired by (and meant 
to compute similar features to) the features described in Rajimehr et al 
(2011) and Nasr & Tootell (2012). 

The features can be used as the basis for encoding models or other image 
analyses.
